If I had a dollar for every time pip's dependency resolver made me question my life choices, I'd have enough funding to start my own package manager. While I'm in love with Python, it's clear that some of its ecosystem and tooling could use some improvement. I've attempted to chip away at this problem on my own by building PyGrab (a high-performance Python HTTP client library written in Rust) to replace requests, and more recently contributing to Mojo as an option to replace/extend Python. However, after trying out Ruff and uv, it's clear to me that the best way I modernize the ecosystem is by joining a team that's already making waves. In addition to having built Python tooling in Rust before, Python and Rust are my 2 favorite and most proficient languages, so it genuinely seems like Astral is the ideal fit for my skills and passions.
